# Lloyds Bank Mortgage Calculator (Forage Simulation), using TypeScript JSX

### Overview

This is the final product I built after completing the Lloyds Bank Technology Engineering Job Simulation on Forage.
It’s a simple, user-friendly React web app that helps users estimate their mortgage payments based on income, property value, deposit, term, and interest rate.

### Features

	•	Two-step input process with validation and helper tooltips
	•	Dynamic mortgage calculation
	•	Interactive UI inspired by Lloyds Bank branding
	•	Built with React and TypeScript

### Tech Stack

	•	React (TypeScript) – Frontend framework
	•	CSS – Styling
	•	Node.js – Runtime environment for local setup

### How to run the app

Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm start
```
The app will run locally at http://localhost:3000. Entering this address in any browser will open up the app.

### How it works

    1.	The user enters financial details (income, credit score, etc.).
    2.	The app validates inputs.
	3.	On submission, it calculates results using calculateMortgage() and displays them on the finish page.

### Important note about the license

This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only — not an official Lloyds Bank product.

## Incentives

I took on this project as I always wondered how designing UI with react works. I've also wanted to practice with CSS and HTML again as I had not done so in a long time.
